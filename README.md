# TransferWise API Postman collections

Here are two Postman collections and environments to help you work with the TransferWise API.

## all-endpoints

This collection holds the full set of endpoint available on our API, organised by resource.

## bank-flow

This collection, aimed at integrating banks, contains the endpoints organised as a flow that matches how a bank's backend would interact with the TransferWise API to build a successful integration. If you are integrating from a bank then please use this collection to learn how the TransferWise flow works.
